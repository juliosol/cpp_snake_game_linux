# cpp_snake_game_linux
This repository contains the code to play a basic snake game written in C++. It was written with the purpose
of practicing C++ coding, so it is based on an implementation by ThePoorEngineer (https://www.thepoorengineer.com/en/snake-cplusplus/)

## Compilation

This code is written for a Linux OS. To compile the cpp file you need to run the command 

```
g++ -o linux_snake linux_snake.cpp -lncurses -lpthread
```

After that, you can run 
```
./linux_snake
```

## Game controls

To move the snake, you do: w for up, s for down, d for right and a for left.

## Videos
